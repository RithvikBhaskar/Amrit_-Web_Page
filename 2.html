    <p>The beginnings of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham can be traced to 1994 when a School of Engineering was started in an obscure village named Ettimadai, at the foothills of Bouluvanpatty ranges of the Western Ghats in the Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu.

        At that time there were 120 students and 13 faculty members. Today, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham has five campuses in three different states of India. There is a student population of over 12,000 and faculty strength of nearly 1500. Over 120 UG, PG and doctoral programs are offered.
        
        When Amrita became a “deemed to be University” in January 2003, it was the youngest group of institutions to be conferred this status. As Amrita’s first campus, Coimbatore is home to the administrative headquarters of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
        Although located in a remote village blessed with panoramic backwater expanses and tiny glistening brooks on the one side and the mighty sea on the other side, our campus seamlessly blends the allure of nature with the provision of contemporary amenities, ensuring an exceptional experience for all. Students are provided with a well-stocked library, enticing cafeterias, and excellent sports facilities, ensuring a fulfilling campus life. The vibrant culture of celebrating festivals and events adds to the stimulating atmosphere on campus. Spanning 80 acres of land, our expansive campus encompasses over a million square feet of built-up area, including academic blocks, student hostels, and a host of other amenities, providing a comprehensive and enriching educational experience.

        Distinguished professors and scholars share their knowledge and experiences with the students. The campus provides all modern amenities from playgrounds to cafeterias.
