    <p>The expansive and serene Brahmasthanam Temple Complex at Edappally, Kochi, by the NH-17 is home to Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kochi, which is candidly achieving fame and glory. The University founded by the well-known humanitarian, Sadguru Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, offers academic education rooted in Indian cultural history. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is a multi-campus, multi-disciplinary research university that is rated as one of the top research universities in India and is certified by NAAC with a “A++” rating.

Modern amenities including laboratories, a large auditorium, a well-stocked library, well-connected smart-classrooms, conference rooms, seminar halls, and more, are artfully juxtaposed.
